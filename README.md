Primary data sets for RNA-seq (RSEM processed and raw reads) can be found in publicly available repositories. 

**All data sets have been carefully curated to remove any identifiable or linkable data**

### Data repositories

Raw sequecincing reads can be found in the Gene Expression Omnibus with accession number [GSE205161](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE205161)

Metadata and scripts to reproduce analysis are shared after providing curation to protect patient data in the Dryad repository
